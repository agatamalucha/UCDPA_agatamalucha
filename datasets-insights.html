                        In this part of my project, I would like find out how all European union counties have managed
                        Covid in analysed
                        period of time by comparing total number of Covid cases and deaths per 10,000 population with
                        countries own
                        characteristics.

                            First of all, I wanted to check if there is correlation between number of cases in each
                            country and their
                            GDP per capita. In this investigation I havenâ€™t noticed any obvious visual correlations. The
                            only thing
                            that is noticeable is 4 out of 5 the richest counties with highest GDP per capita ( please
                            see Economical
                            Dataset analysis) Ireland, Denmark, Finland has the total lowest number of COVID cases.

                                In this pair of features you can notice not definite but noticeable relation. Number of
                                Covid deaths is
                                slightly falling as falling the median age of population in the country. Countries with
                                higher median age
                                experienced higher number of Covid cases in total.

                    On this chart I can see that countries with number of days higher than average in school
                    lockdown have
                    experienced high number of deaths (Czechia, Slovenia, Slovakia). On the other side of
                    chart there are
                    countries like Latvia, Germany, Ireland, Greece, Malta with also high number of school
                    closed days but
                    less than average deaths. I will look into those counties in final chart, as those group
                    of countries
                    might have more things in common.

                <p>
                    On this chart there is visible relation between number of nursing staff and number of days in
                    school/ internal movement lockdown. You can see that countries with high level of staffing have
                    experienced lower level of restriction as number of nurses is falling countries implemented longer
                    and more server lockdown. There is one more interesting fact that I have noticed that when I taking
                    into account GDP per capita, wealthy countries Ireland, Germany , Finland , Luxembourg have high
                    number of staff.

                    In this chart I compared new number of deaths with number of days in both internal movement
                    restriction and school closures. Again, the worst situation can be observed in eastern European
                    countries even though they had longer /higher level of restrictions. On the other hand, we have
                    Finland, Denmark, Malta, Estonia. Even though they had no restrictions they had low number of
                    deaths. Ireland, German and Greece kept their restriction for longer and that helped them to keep
                    number of deaths lower than average in EU.

                    I am continuing analysing impact of policies on course of Covid cases through out the whole period
                    of pandemic. Covid was a new disease, so as precaution all European countries closed schools and
                    restricted internal movements, even though there was a very low number of new Covid cases. Europe
                    have started extreme lockdown. This can be observed between March 2020 and May 2020. As we were
                    learning more about Covid and reporting low number of cases, all EU started ceasing on restrictions.
                    You can see that particularly between July-Sept 2020. The next turning point happened in
                    October/November 2020, Covid cases started dramatically increase. Countries decided to introduce
                    lockdowns again, however in less strict conditions. Prolonged period of lockdown at the start of
                    pandemic, probably has put counties in economic trouble and also politicians started to encounter
                    society resistance on severe lockdown. From January 2021 up to the current date the number of cases
                    remained quite high with higher level of restrictions. Only in April /May 2021 countries have
                    dropped restrictions as they strongly think that implementation of vaccination against Covid will
                    suppress the disease.
