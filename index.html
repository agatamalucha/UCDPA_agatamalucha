        <p>
          Year 2020 was undoubtedly dominated by the pandemic caused by the new SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus. The pandemic
          has created many challenges for governments, enterprises and society globally. All countries in the world have
          been affected by the illness. Some of them have been hit harder than the others. As a healthcare worker who
          works in the hospital, I had great interest in all information about development of this disease, and I was
          especially concerned about situation in Europe.

        </p>
        <p>
          In every country in the world governments had to make difficult decision how to save public health from COVID
          illness. Were they successful? Which EU countries were hit the most with Covid cases and deaths? Did high
          numbers of hospital beds and healthcare workers helped in keeping low number of patient’s deaths?
          Is there any correlation between countries with low GDP and higher number of COVID cases? Did school closures
          and restriction of movement make any difference keeping the low number of cased? Were population with higher
          median age in worse situation through out the year of pandemic? There are a lot of questions and I would like
          to find answers for some of them.

          Dataset have been provided by World Health Organization website in .csv format. Original dataset
          contains number of new cases, cumulative cases, and new deaths and cumulative deaths. Dataset has a minimum
          amount of missing data and contains worldwide daily data. In my project I use number of new cases and deaths
          and they will be recalculated to show cases and deaths per 10 000 population.

            Three major factors to be considered when analyzing healthcare services in each European countries are:
            available hospital beds, amount of nursing staff and number of physicians per 1000 population.
            Best website to acquire all necessary data is World Bank where the relevant data is being collected since
            1960.

            Probably the most curious case and also the subject that create a lot of controversy is impact of the lockdown policies and strategies on flattening COVID-19 cases curve.
            After some research, I've found two relevant datasets. First one shows when schools were closed in each European country, second one refers to movement restrictions.
            Both of them can be found in "Our World in Data" dataset collection.
